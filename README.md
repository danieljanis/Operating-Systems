# Operating-Systems
CS 4760 - Operating Systems at UMSL

#### Description: 
> This course covers the structure of generic operating systems, considering in detail the algorithms for interprocess communicaiton, process scheduling, resource management, memory management, file systems, and device management. It presents examples from contemporary operating systems. This course also requires practical projects implemented within a modern operating system or simulator environment.

#### Topics
> We'll discuss the structure of a generic operating system, with an emphasis on the algorithms and data structures needed to perform various tasks to manage processes, resources, memory, files, and I/O devices. There will be extensive programming in C under Linux environment. The sequences of topics will be as follows (in that order):
> - Function, Types, and Structure of Operating Systems
> - Concurrent Programming, Process Interaction and Synchronization
> - Process Management and Scheduling
> - Resource Management and Deadlocks
> - Memory Management
> - File System and I/O management

#### Assignments:
> - Unix System Calls and Library Functions
> - Concurrent UNIX Processes and shared memory
> - Message Passing and Operating System Simulator
> - Process Scheduling
> - Resource management
> - Memory management
