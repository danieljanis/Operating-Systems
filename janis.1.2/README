This executable "proc_fan" takes input from a source that can be funneled into
it. "proc_fan" will read the file funnled into it line by line, forking a new
process for each line and executing that line with the given arguements. The amount
of processes is limited based on the usage of the "proc_fan" program. The usage
for the "proc_fan" command is shown below:

USAGE:

[1.] ./proc_fan -n [#] 

    ** where the [#] is the option to indicate the maximum number
       of processes allowed to be generated at once (limited from 1-27)

    ** you can funnel an input file containing various lines of
       command-line-containing executables here like so:

           ./proc_fan -n 2 < testing.data
    
    *** where testing.data contains many lines of command-lines to execute

[2.] ./proc_fan -h

    ** this will print a usage message and exit

[3.] ./proc_fan

    ** this should give an error, including a usage line.

VERSION CONTROL:
I have used git for my version control for this assignment. Versioning is done
with git and I have committed changes as I progresses throughout this assignment.

COMMENTS:

- There was an error that I had encountered when trying to run a file containing
  more than 28 command-lines with the option of -n 28. This problem occurred when
  a child had failed to fork and mentioned that the "resource was unavailable."
  Because of this I have chosen to limit the user to 27 active processes, due to the
  off-chance that this could happen again (I tested files with 27 commands and -n 27 
  did not produce a similar error).

    *** I have these test files saved in a copy of this directory for testing  ***
               testing.data contains 5 command-lines, no errors
               testing1.data contains 1 command-line, no error
               testing2.data contains 12 command-lines, no errors
               testing3.data contains 1 command-line with 3 arguments, no errors
               testing4.data contains 1 jibberish sentence,
                   - gives an error, failed to execute the child 
               testing5.data contains a ton of command-line arguments
